# Highlight Organizer

Code for a small private website that organizes soccer highlights so they are easy to find later and can be browsed without spoilers.

I watch highlights several times a week and found existing sources frustrating to navigate once you fall behind. It's currently live and I share the URL with a few friends.

There's a python backend, postgres db, and flask renders minimal html.
